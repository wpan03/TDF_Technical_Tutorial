Significance: FAW currently does not have a manufacturing base in South Africa and it exports its vehicles to the country from China. With its investment in South Africa, the group aims to use the country as an export base for other parts of Africa. FAW's ZAR600-million plant forms part of the group's ZAR817-million investment in South Africa, with the balance to be used to develop grassroots part suppliers. China's CAD Fund, developed under the auspices of President Hu Jin Tao in 2006, has been used to help Chinese automakers enter markets in Africa. So far, Chinese automakers developing a presence in Africa include Chery, Lifan, and Brilliance (see Kenya: 11 August 2011: ; China - Ethiopia: 4 May 2011: ; and China - Benin: 4 May 2011: ). FAW also aims to tap into the vast opportunities that the emerging economies of the African region offer, given that not many established OEMs have a significant presence in the continent.

Main commissioning was scheduled for 2018 and full production was anticipated in 2023. The loan was pledged in 2011 and confirmed in January 2013, and the first drawing from this loan occurred in January 2014. The loan had an interest rate of six-month Libor + 3.5%, with a grace period of 6 years and a maturity of 15 years. In January 2013, the average Libor rate was 0.160%, so the total interest rate at the time of signing was 3.66%. Part of the $650-million loan would be used to refund two separate $100-million short-term loans (#58675 and #58676). The Bakubung mine, which has an expected economic life span of 35 years, is likely to manufacture 350,000oz of platinum group metals at a cost of R12bn per annum.

"43190","true","false","China","China Development Bank that is expected to yield a loan in the region of US$5-billion (R45-billion) to help finance South Africa's rail infrastructure","2013","false","Transnet in Chinese Rail Funding Pact Mar 27, 2013 (SouthAfrica.info/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- South African state-owned freight logistics company Transnet has signed a 'ground-breaking' agreement with the China Development Bank that is expected to yield a loan in the region of US$5-billion (R45-billion) to help finance the country's massive rail infrastructure upgrade programme. The agreement, signed during a meeting between President Jacob Zuma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Pretoria on Tuesday, would enable Transnet and the China Development Bank to 'identify opportunities ... for future collaboration in Transnet's infrastructure upgrade programmes,' Transnet said in a statement. The cooperation agreed upon would include 'the financing of the construction and upgrade of railway and port infrastructure and localisation of equipment manufacturing. 'In addition, the two agreed on future collaboration on research and development initiatives, manufacturing, marketing and the construction of cross-border infrastructure throughout the continent,' Transnet said. Transnet Group chief executive Brian Molefe said the agreement, signed as the 5th BRICS (Brazil, Russia , India, China and South Africa) summit got under way in Durban on Tuesday, was proof of the opportunities created by South Africa's membership of the grouping. Transnet last year announced an unprecedented R300-billion capital investment programme to revamp and expand its ports, rail and pipelines infrastructure and equipment, saying it would create over half-a-million new jobs while making its freight rail division the fifth-largest in the world. The company plans to spend the lion's share of this, R205-billion, on rail projects - R151-billion on freight rail - as it pushes to increase its freight rail volumes from about 200-million to 350-million tons by 2019, while increasing its market share of South African container traffic from around 79% to 92%. This increase would significantly reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa, Transnet said at the time, citing internal studies showing that rail in the country was on average 75% cheaper than road transport. The company said that about two-thirds of the required funding for the programme would be raised internally and the remainder in the international debt capital market. As part of this programme, Transnet has already awarded contracts to a number of manufacturers, including the United States' General Electric, Finnish crane maker Kalmar, and China South Railways. In October, a consortium led by Chinese manufacturer CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive (CSR) was named as the winning bidder to supply Transnet with 95 electric locomotives. Transnet will pay R2.6-billion (about $300-million) for the 95 locomotives, the first 10 of which are being assembled in CSR's factories in China, while the remainder will be made in South Africa.

The two countries will 'explore ways to enhance capacity building in mining, construction and other industries' according to the communique, issued during a visit to the Chinese capital by South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. In June, Beijing launched the $5 billion China-Africa Development Fund, with initial capital of $1 billion, to help finance Chinese investments in Africa, part of Beijing's pledge to double its aid to the continent. Beijing is increasingly using its massive foreign reserves to lend to Africa, paving the way for its state-owned firms to bid on mining and infrastructure projects as it tries to secure raw materials supply for its booming economy. The countries also agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in a variety of fields, particularly aquaculture and agricultural products. China increased the number of scholarships offered to South African students. 'The Chinese side noted with appreciation the position taken by South Africa and other countries, against Taiwan's bid for U.N. membership during the 62nd session of the U.N.

"30461","true","false","China","China Investment Corporation purchases 25% stake in Shanduka Group (duplicate of #30462)","2012","false","Euro crisis ‘has little effect’ on Chinese interest in SA Financial Services Editor COMPANIES in sectors such as construction and resources are being targeted by Chinese investors wanting to use SA as a base to leapfrog into Africa, Standard Bank said yesterday. Standard’s co-head for mergers and acquisitions in SA, Brad Webber, said the interest shown in SA by Chinese companies had not been materially affected by Europe’s problems. Nor had signs of China’s faltering economic growth reduced the appetite of its companies to make big ticket acquisitions in Africa and SA. These included the $1,3bn sale of copper producer Metorex to Jinchuan, which was completed this week and was the largest deal by China in Africa last year. A 25% stake in Cyril Ramaphosa’s Shanduka Group was sold to China Investment Corporation, a sover-eign wealth fund, for R2bn. Standard — 20% owned by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China — advised on both transactions, bringing to more than R10bn the value of merger and acquisition deals by Chinese companies in Africa it had advised in the past year. & Africa still has significant opportunities and what we are seeing are Chinese companies looking to South African companies to grow their footprint into the continent,& Mr Webber said. & We have seen interest in the resources sector and this can be shown by the Metorex deal which is a copper producer and China has significant appetite for copper, while the Shanduka Group is also strong on resources.& Chinese firms were investing in infrastructure projects in several African countries ranging from roads to power stations. & We are seeing much interest from the Chinese in SA infrastructure and construction companies, particularly those that supply products,& he said. An investment in construction-related companies is a boost for a sector that has struggled to get work since the 2010 Soccer World Cup infrastructure projects ended. The sector’s situation was worsened by the cancellation of projects in places such as the Middle East as investors cut budgets in response to the credit crisis. Mr Webber warned a worsening of the global economic climate, fuelled in part by Europe’s debt crisis, could affect, but not stop, Chinese activity. & Problems in Europe will not help and we will definitely see a drop in mergers and acquisition activity,& Mr Webber said. & We (however) expect a significant increase this year in Chinese mergers and acquisition activity in Africa but all depends on what happens in Europe,& he said. Standard estimated such activity had grown by almost 90% to $5bn. Other China-Africa transactions in which Standard was involved included the Botswana Morupule Power Project, a $400m debt refinance deal with Equinox, and a $470m export finance facility for Ethiopian Hydro Power. kamhungas@bdfm.co.za ","240","Banking and Financial Services","shares in investment holding company","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment","South Africa","","0","China Investment Corporation, Private Sector","Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., Private Sector","China Investment Corporation, Private Sector","1","","","Raw","0","Unset","","Commercial","2","Inactive","2","","2000000000.0","ZAR","0.99011154","8.207109466","246124953.588564","243691156.830002","","","","","1","South Africa","560","218","South Africa","ZAF","ZA","710","199","false","false","false","false","","","","","","2014-10-16 17:21:55 -0400","","",0

All rights reserved.The China-Africa Business Council (CABC) was established yesterday to promote Sino-African investment and trade.The CABC is the first public-private partnership between the world's largest developing country and the continent. It was jointly established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Chinese Government and the Society for the Promotion of the Guangcai Programme.'The project we are signing here today is a key initiative to help strengthen China-Africa economic links through promotion of Public Private Partnerships,' said Khalik Malik, UN resident co-ordinator and UNDP resident representative, at the signing ceremony.Speaking highly of China's role in South-South co-operation, Malik noted that there are challenges for China's businesses looking for accurate information when they conduct trade and investment in Africa.'The CABC was created to become a new economic mechanism which will help facilitate information sharing and access, thereby deepening Sino-African trade and investment,' he said.Driven by the private sector with public sector support, the CABC will be set up between China and six African nations - Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania, officials said.'Political progress has been made between China and Africa within the framework of Sino-Africa Co-operation Forum during the past years,' said Wang Yue, director general of the China International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) under the Ministry of Commerce. 'Meanwhile, practical economic co-operation requires co-ordination within enterprise circles from both sides.'Different from other programmes, the CABC will let non-State-owned enterprises play an important role and 'no field limitations will be set on the co-operation between the enterprises,' Wang said.Trade between China and Africa is growing rapidly. Statistics show that the trading volume between the two soared to US$18 billion last year from US$2 billion in 1999.Officials said that China and Africa are planning to double the 2002 level to reach US$30 billion in 2006.Under the support of the UN and governments, it is crucial for the CABC programme to arouse the interest of private companies to reduce poverty through investment, said Hu Deping, vice-president of the Guangcai Programme.The programme has 14,000 non-State-owned companies as members.The CABC programme will officially be launched in January 2005 and last until the end of 2007.'If it turns out that the mechanism works well, the relevant parties involved will certainly seek a further extension,' said CICETE Director-General Wang.(Copyright 2001 by China Daily)Document CHNDLY0020041117e0bi0005m","","Unset","General Trade-Investment Organization","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Africa, regional, Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CHNDLY0020041117e0bi0005m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","1","","","China-Africa Business Council, International NGO","1","","","Raw","0","OOF-like","3","Unset","0","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CHNDLY0020041117e0bi0005m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","","","","","","","","","","7","Africa, regional","452; 510; 541; 471; ; 475; 560","241; 282; 259; 229; 298; 261; 218","Ghana; Tanzania; Mozambique; Cameroon; Africa, regional; Nigeria; South Africa","GHA; TZA; MOZ; CMR; Africa, regional; NGA; ZAF","GH; TZ; MZ; CM; XR; NG; ZA","288; 834; 508; 120; ; 566; 710","652; 738; 688; 622; ; 694; 199","false","false","false","false","","","","","","2012-11-20 10:15:00 -0500","","",0

Ltd. (PAM.JO) to a consortium that includes three Chinese investors for 4.07 billion rand (476 million USD). The mining giants had announced plans to sell out of the business in September 2011, saying South Africa's only refined copper producer didn't have the scale to fit their investment strategies even though studies were under way to extend its life. It is expected to run out of copper in early 2016. Media sources from the time of the announcement reported that Chinese state-owned Hebei Iron and Steel Group Co Ltd (HBIS) would own 35% shares of Palabora, General Nice Development Ltd, a privately owned Chinese trading company, would take 25%, and Chinese state-owned Tewoo Group Co. Ltd, a major diversified group, and South Africa's state-backed Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Ltd, would each have 20%. However, these stakes add up to 100%, more than the 74.5% that these sources report the consortium buying. It is possible that some of the companies within the consortium already owned part of Palabora, but which of the companies owned how much is unknown. Moreover, a 2018 MOFCOM press release listed the China-Africa Development Fund as one of the owners in addition to HBIS, General Nice, and Tewoo.

Zuma said: 'What we now seek to address jointly is to find the means towards a more equitable balance of trade. The ongoing co-operation among the business sector in both countries is a step in the right direction in this regard.' Jinping told reporters the people of China and South Africa enjoyed a profound traditional relationship. 'Just now President Zuma and I held productive talks, and we witnessed the signing of agreements between our relevant government departments and enterprises. In our talks just now we both reviewed and commended the fruitful results that we have achieved in the last 15 years of our diplomatic relations.' He said they also discussed relations between China and Africa, the fifth Brics summit, and international and regional issues of mutual interest.

"1407","true","false","China","Lesotho Highlands Power Project, duplicate of #55920","2011","false","In November 2011, Lesotho revealed plans for the Lesotho Highlands Power Project, under which a 10 gW renewable energy power-plant will be built. Unnamed Chinese firms will provide loans to finance about 80% of the project which is expected to cost 110 billion ZAR. Equity for the project will come from Breeze Power, a joint venture between the Lesotho government and South Africa's Harrison and White Investments. Of the 10 gW of power, 6 gW will come from wind energy, and 4 gW will come from pumped-storage hydro power. Construction on the first phase of the project is slated to begin in 2012 with the construction of a 150 mW wind farm. By 2016, 600 mW of the wind capacity is planned to be online. As part of this project, manufacturing facilities will be built in Lesotho and South Africa. China’s Ming Yang Wind Power Company will supply the majority of wind turbines for this project. In 2012, contracts were signed with Mops Civil for the construction of a 3.8 km access road and with South African BKS for the construction of a measuring weir. The road was completed in November 2011 while the weir was still under construction and expected to be completed by September 2012. The timeline for this project is as follows: environmental and social baseline studies from August 2012 to July 2020, construction tenders from November 2012 to January 2015, construction of advance infrastructure from July 2014 to December 2015, construction of the Polihali dam and tunnel from January 2016 to March 2020, completion of a pump storage feasibility study in August 2012 with provisional construction from January 2013 to December 2017, and completion of impoundment to 2,000 meters above sea level in August 2018, with the first water being delivered to South Africa in August 2020. In 2012, Lesotho Water and Environment Minister Edna Molewa was quoted as saying that loan capital for the dam portion of the project had not yet been secured. STAFF_NOTES: Since the financing comes from unnamed Chinese firms, the project's classification was left as Vague (Commercial). There is no evidence that a government entity was involved.","230","Energy Generation and Supply","","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Lesotho, South Africa","http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/two-contracts-awarded-for-phase-2-of-lesotho-water-project-2012-07-12, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://apperi.org/2011/10/, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.cpeinet.com.cn/sbzz/zzydt/201111/t20111102_172307.htm, Other; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=RECHGE0020111115e7b400037&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/lesotho-harness-wind-water-energy, Media Report, including Wikileaks","5","Lesotho Government, Government Agency; Harrison and White Investments, Private Sector","Mops Civil; Ming Yang Wind Power, Private Sector; Breeze Power Company, Public Private Partnership; BKS Group (pty) Ltd., Private Sector","Ming Yang Wind Power, Private Sector","1","Mops Civil; Lesotho Government, Government Agency; Harrison and White Investments, Private Sector; Breeze Power Company, Public Private Partnership","4","Checked","1","Vague (Com)","13","Commercial","2","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=RECHGE0020111115e7b400037&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","110000000000.0","ZAR","0.94418159","7.263198205","16040180875.481","15144843482.8993","","","","","2","Africa, regional","560; 570","218; 249","South Africa; Lesotho","ZAF; LSO","ZA; LS","710; 426","199; 666","false","false","true","false","","","","","","2019-06-12 11:20:57 -0400","Lesotho Highlands Water Project","Monyane Moleleki, Natural Resources Minister (Lesotho Government); Edna Molewa, Water and Environment Minister (Lesotho Government)",0

'Asignificant number of tour operators are switching their programmes fromother destinations to South Africa and certain operators are consideringcharter programmes for the first time. We have received very positivefeedback from the operators regarding future growth and have had manyenquiries for quotations for large numbers of passengers for both 2003 and.2004.'Ms Scott said that the USA and Asian markets were significantly affected bythe events of September 11, which resulted in passenger volumes remainingstatic for the six months from July to December. 'In spite of this decline,margins and the overall performance of the inbound division improved.Confirmed volumes for the next six months are heartening and all being well,this division should finish the year on a good note.'Following the terror attacks certain companies put an embargo on travellingoverseas for three months which caused a decline in outbound passengers, butMs Scott reports that the domestic corporate market is showing signs ofimprovement. In the past few moths there has been a substantial drop in thenumber of outbound leisure passengers which can be attributed to both.September 11 as well as the depreciation of the Rand.Ms Scott said that it is vital that South Africa extends the tourism seasonbeyond its current five months, as any marked increase in tourist volumeswill be impacted by the availability of airline seats and accommodation.'As a country we need to make a concerted and tourism-wide effort tosubstantially improve service standards if we want to entrench SouthAfrica's position as a high quality, affordable destination.'Tourvest's merchandise, duty free, outbound and financial services divisionwhich includes American Express Foreign Exchange is performing well.'The only division under pressure at the moment is the outbound division butwe are addressing this and are gaining new accounts through more aggressivemarketing and service.'According to Ms Scott, the European market, particularly the British market,will grow substantially. However, the market with the greatest potential isthe Chinese market, since the Chinese government has awarded South Africapreferred destination status. 'Although we anticipate the main benefits ofthis will be felt in the latter part of 2002, we are already experiencinglarge increases in numbers from China and other parts of Asia over theprevious year.'Ms Scott concluded that potential exists to grow revenues from all ofTourvest's businesses, particularly its retail and merchandising divisionwhich secures a large portion of its business from the internationaltourist. There is also potential revenue growth in both inbound and foreignexchange.

They have pleaded not guilty to charges of armed robbery.by Fortunate MabuzaCopyright African Eye News Service.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A rare Chinese tiger brought to South Africa to learn how to hunt has died, dealing a fresh blow to efforts to save the species from extinction. Born in a Chinese zoo, 'Hope' was sent to South Africa as a cub with his mate 'Cathay' in 2003 for a pioneering experiment seen by some as the last chance to preserve the species -- a 'rewilding program' to encourage the animals to hunt on their own.Africa needs fish farms to offset dwindling supplyABUJA (Reuters) - Investment in fish farms in Africa is urgently needed to halt a decline in fish consumption in the continent because natural stocks cannot keep up with population growth, experts said on Monday. Some 200 million Africans rely on fish as a main part of their diet, but the continent is the only region in the world where fish supplies per capita are falling, according to reports prepared for a 'Fish for All' summit in the Nigerian capital.Japan to promote 'Warm Biz' look to save energyTOKYO (Reuters) - Spurred by the success of a 'Cool Biz' campaign this summer that encouraged men to dress down to save energy, Japan plans to continue conservation efforts this fall and winter by promoting 'Warm Biz' fashion.

Saturday's violence at the Tian Neng Battery Co. was also the third protest in the eastern province of Zhejiang in recent months caused by pollution, highlighting the environmental price of China's rise to become the world's seventh-largest economy.Mirant may shut Potomac River plant due to pollutionNEW YORK (Reuters) - Mirant Corp. on Monday said it may shut down its Potomac River generating station in two days unless it can resolve concerns about the air quality in the vicinity of the power plant. The bankrupt power company has already reduced output at the plant's five units to their 'lowest feasible levels' in response to the concerns, according to a statement.Hong Kong finds suspected carcinogen in fish from ChinaHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government said on Sunday it had discovered a suspected cancer-causing chemical in some freshwater fish imported from China, but denied the mainland had suspended exports to the territory.

"32911","true","false","Saudi Arabia","SFD to fund 16.4 million USD for Markala sugar project in Mali","2011","false","Kexim commits to Malian sugar project 499 words 2 March 2011 Trade Finance TRAFIN English Copyright 2011 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC The Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim), alongside a raft of development banks, has committed a $21.5 million loan for the Markala sugar project in Mali. The 30-year facility constitutes 8% of the financing for the $259.5 million agricultural component of the project, designed to tap Mali’s sugarcane development potential. The funds will be used to develop 14,132 ha of spray-irrigation farms at Markala, 275 km northeast of Bamako, on the north bank of the Niger River, as well implement accompanying social and environmental initiatives. The farms are expected to yield 1.48 million tonnes of sugarcane per year to satisfy the domestic market and foreign trade with neighbouring Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal. Project company Sugarcane Development Corporation (CaneCo) is 90% owned by the Malian government and will manage 60% the sugarcane farming area, with a federation of 560 independent farmers controlling the remaining 40%. The co-financiers for the agricultural component are the Malian government contributing $82.5 million, the African Development Bank (AfDB) with $42.7 million, the West African Development Bank (WADB) with $22.4 million, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) with $21.1 million, the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) with $19.9 million, the Kuwait Fund (KFAED) with $17 million, the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) with $16.4 million, the OPEC Fund with $16.1 (OFID) and the project’s strategic partner, South African sugar producer Illovo. The initial loan agreement between the two primary financiers AfDB and the Malian government was signed in December 2010, with approval from the other financiers due to take place before February 2011. Apart from the Malian government facility and the Kuwait Fund, who are yet to set loan terms, all the debt facilities have a tenor of 30 years. The IsDB and AfDB have set the lowest interest rate at 0.75%; Kexim, OFID and the SFD have set pricing at 1%; the WADB have opted for 2%; and EBID for 3%. There is also an industrial component to the project, on which construction will begin following the completion of the farms in late 2012. The project company for the industrial segment Markala Sugar Company (SoSuMar) will develop the facility, to be financed by the private sector. It will consist of a plant with an annual output of 190,000 tonnes of sugar, 15 million litres of ethanol and the cogeneration of 30MW of electricity. Financing on both components are due to close in mid-2011. Private investors hold 97.5% of share capital in SoSuMar: Illovo (65%), SAIL 2.5% and Malian private investors 30%. The Malian government holds the remaining 2.5%. The total project costs, including the agricultural and industrial component, will reach $557 million and the facility will be fully operational in late 2015. Interestingly, it is also the first Public-Private Partnership (PPP) operation between the Malian government and the AfDB, in the agro-industrial sector.

All rights reserved. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DFIs: A catalyst for cautious investors 1632 words 4 May 2011 Trade Finance TRAFIN English Copyright 2011 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC With the expansion of trade facilitation programmes, other products available through development banks and multilaterals can often be overlooked. But at a time when commercial liquidity cannot meet demand in emerging markets, these organisations are stepping up their activity to support some key projects. Developmental finance institutions (DFIs) continue to combat the capital deficit from the ground up. The IFC’s global trade liquidity programme (GTLP) helps boost the lending powers of cash-strapped local banks, but increasingly they are called upon to offer direct funding. Glancing through the ECA and DFI section of this magazine, names of multilateral institutions - such as the IFC, the Asian Development Bank and the EBRD - keep cropping up in numerous financings for project and resource development. IFC support for Vodaphone Ghana’s expansion project in March exemplifies its role in packaging debt to attract commercial bank investment. In this deal, IFC adopted the majority of the debt, $200 million, under three tranches, with Standard Chartered picking up a $25 million ticket. The proceeds will be used to develop infrastructure and purchase GSM equipment from Chinese telecoms solutions provider Huawei Technologies. March was also a busy month for IFC’s representatives in Brazil. Several commercial banks committed to an A/B financing facility for the development of a new container terminal in the Port of Santos, Sao Paulo, in what became IFCs largest ever syndication. The $679 million financing, for Brasil Terminal Portuario (BTP), was split between a $97 million long-term A-loan from IFC, and a $582 million B-loan from commercial banks including Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole CIB, DnB Nor Bank, ING Capital, and KfW IPEX Bank. Equity investment will make up the remainder of the $900 million terminal, which will add 1.1 million TEU to Latin America’s largest port. Although IFC were the only multilateral involved in the transaction, at the time of signing the Inter-American Development Bank and Caixa Economica Federal were also nearing close on a separate $800 million financing for port developers DP World and Odebrecht’s Embraport at the Port of Santos. This facility will add 1.2 million TEU and roughly 2 million tonnes of liquid bulk capacity to the port. IFCs 2010 annual report shows that it entered into $12.7 billion of debt and equity commitments compared to $10.5 billion in 2009. Of the $5.7 billion of loans, $1.2 billion used an A/B loan structure, $797 million was structured finance and $734 million are labeled parallel loans. Parallel loans are loans from other financial institutions that the IFC has helped arrange but is not a lender of record. It is in this regard that IFC stands out as a facilitator. An increase in parallel loans may reflect the assumption amongst DFIs that facilitating debt is less intrusive than co-financing it. The Asian Development Bank notes that its main concern with co-financed strategies (CFS) is that it could have an adverse affect on the voluntary private flow of income to developing countries as corporates become too reliant on these facilities. With high demand for investment, the banks’ exposure through CFS is a potential threat to its creditor status as it commits to riskier ventures. However, for the foreseeable future it remains unlikely that financing of this type will crowd out private investment as there is simply not enough appetite for long-tenor loans in the market. The ADB has the capacity to offer loans with 21 year maturities in the public sector and 13 years in the private sector. With the lead and/or support of DFIs in a range of capacities, it not only provides comfort to the commercial banks but also allows them to gain involvement in markets and sectors that would otherwise be off-limits. Back in February, ADB financed the third tranche of an $800 million credit facility to the Indian government to transform Himachal Pradesh into the ‘hydropower state’ of India. The tranche of $208 million will fund around 70% of the 100 MW Sainj hydropower project and certain civil works, and the electro-mechanical works (e.g. turbines, etc.) for the 195 MW Kashang hydropower project. It is part of an eight-year financing agreement with an estimated completion date of 30 September 2016. The estimated cost of the total project, which also includes the completed Sawra Kuddu hydroplant, is $1.5 billion: $800 million is to be contributed by ADB; $450 million by the Indian government; and the final $250 million was to be supported by other financial partners. A source close to the deal informs Trade Finance that the remaining funds, totaling $382.9 million, are expected to be disbursed in a fourth and final tranche before the end of the agreed period. The source confirms that there have been no other financial institutions involved to date, but the fourth and final tranche will require additional loan funds that are as yet unspecified. Initial research by ADB in 2008 estimated the combined rate of return for both the Kashang and Sawra Kuddu subprojects was 18.7% but repayment periods on all ADB tranches are 25 years. These kind of long-tenor loans based on estimated returns are clearly unattractive for commercial lenders; without ADB’s support a project of this magnitude and expense may never have got off the ground. EBRD also turned its attention to hydropower development last month, but in Macedonia, and in the private sector. The a6 million loan provided to Macedonian PCC Hydro DOOEL Skopje, a subsidiary of Germany’s PCC SE and private sector development bank Deutsche Investitions (DEG), will finance the construction of four small hydro power facilities with a total capacity of 4.1 MW. The loan is the EBRD’s second private sector energy generation investment in Macedonia and is supported by an agreement signed with the FYR Macedonian Ministry of Economy. As well as Macedonian government assistance, the facility is supported by technical assistance funds from the Western Balkans Fund, the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund and the Norwegian government. Engagement in public and private sector ventures which match development banks’ policies for renewable energy, sustainable growth and poverty reduction continue to meet the demands of rapidly industrialising nations. Dialogue between these multilateral organisations and the government agencies of developed nations are essential to promoting trade finance initiatives. Recently DFIs have been formalising these relationships through memorandums of understanding (MoU). In April, ADB and OPEC’s Fund for International Development (OFID) signed an MoU; these two organisations have worked together since 1976 on over 90 projects, amounting to $765 million, but yet they both saw fit to formalise their partnership this year. Steven Beck, ADB’s trade finance head recognizes the importance of the collaborative effort needed to support larger projects which can require the support of multiple development banks, export credit agencies and commercial lenders. Beck, says: “The more entities that we can crowd into the process the better. It will bring more resources to some of the most challenging markets in Asia. The further and broader the risks are disbursed also brings additional comfort. This year we have signed risk sharing agreements with FMO and EFIC, are confirming risk share with OFID and will soon be announcing a similar arrangement with one of the largest insurance companies in the world.” OFID, alongside a number of DFIs, entered into a financing agreement for Mali’s Markala sugar project in February, which is a fine example of a combined effort to push through an ambitious public-private venture. A raft of development banks and the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) committed to a 30-year, $259.5 million loan for the agricultural component of the project designed to tap Mali’s sugarcane development potential. The initial loan agreement between the two primary financiers, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Malian government, was signed in December 2010, with approval from the other financiers taking place in February 2011. The Malian government and AfDB contributed $82.5 million and $42.7 million respectively. The other financiers were the West African Development Bank (WADB) with $22.4 million, Kexim with $21.5 million, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) with $21.1 million, the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) with $19.9 million, the Kuwait Fund (KFAED) with $17 million, the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) with $16.4 million, OFID with $16.1 and the project’s strategic partner, South African sugar producer Illovo. In terms of margin, there is a spread across the organisations: the IsDB and AfDB set the lowest interest rate at 0.75%; Kexim, OFID and the SFD set pricing at 1%; the WADB have opted for 2%; and EBID for 3%. It is the official position of development banks not to undercut the market price. The low interest rates set by primary financier AfDB on the Markala financing, clearly demonstrate an urge to close the deal rather than drive margins. One person who knows the importance of development bank financing is Bob Chestnutt, project director at Aldwych International, whose company is sponsoring the 300MW Lake Turkana wind project in Kenya. The project is expected to meet financial close by the end of the year, once the offtaker resolves risk-sharing issues in the power purchase agreement. However, the project has the support of the AfDB, without whom, Chestnutt maintains, it would not have progressed to this stage. On top of this, the AfDB is assuming political risk while issuing a margin that does not exceed commercial market price. As someone who has worked with development banks throughout his career, Chestnutt is adamant that the altruistic ambition of these organisations will remain the catalyst for investment in challenging markets.
